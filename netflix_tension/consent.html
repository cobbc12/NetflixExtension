<h1>UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON CONSENT FORM</h1>
Researchers: Tadayoshi Kohno, Associate Professor, Paul G. Allen School of
Computer Science and Engineering, (206) xxx-xxxx.

<h2>Video Survey</h2>
We are asking you to be in a research study. This form gives you information to
help you decide whether or not to be in the study. Being in the study is
voluntary. Please read this carefully. You may ask any questions about the
study. Then you can decide whether or not you want to be in the study.

<h2>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</h2>
We are investigating how people perceive computer security and privacy scenarios
in media such as TV shows, movies, and online videos. We are interested in how
media influences people's security and privacy preferences and practices, as
well as how realistic people think computer security and privacy is portrayed.

<h2>STUDY PROCEDURES</h2>
We will use the extension you just installed to monitor your video consumption
across the Internet. This includes what you are watching, when you watch it,
how much of it you watch, and what parts of it you watch. Through the extension,
we will occasionally prompt you with questions, such as whether you think the
scene you just watched was realistic, if you have experienced similar scenarios,
or your opinions about certain security and privacy practices. While you can
answer these questions with a mouse and/or keyboard, you may also consent
to verbally answering certain questions (for example, if you are watching on a
TV and do not want to use your phone or laptop to answer). When you consent to
verbally answer questions, we will use your browser's speech recognition API to
convert your speech into text. While your voice is temporarily recorded, we will
only receive your responses in text form. You may decline to answer any question
at any time without penalty. You may also temporarily disable or uninstall this
extension to avoid any data being collected. No data will be collected in your
browser's Incognito mode. We may also collect information about your usage of
the extension (such as how often you use it and when you consented to
participate in this story) and information about your computer and/or phone.

<h2>RISKS, STRESS, OR DISCOMFORT</h2>
We will be collecting your video consumption history across the Internet. 
You may be uncomfortable or embarassed if someone discovers your viewing
history. While all data is collected anonymously, it may be possible to
deanonymize the data, particularly if you publicly review videos or movies you
watch. While the data we collect is transmitted, processed, and stored securely,
there is a risk that these systems may be breached, in which case your data may
be exposed. While we believe our extension is bug-free, there is always a risk
that this extension may have flaws or conflict with other software you have
installed, potentially affecting the reliability and/or security of your phone
or computer. Like any other extention, there is a small risk that a malicious
update to this extension is pushed to your computer by hackers. We use
hardware-based two-factor authentication to secure our accounts used to publish
this extension. Finally, if your video consumption history becomes subject to
civil or criminal legal proceedings, we may be compelled to provide your data,
especially if the unique ID we assign your computer is obtained. Your history
will be retained by us even if you delete your browser history. 

<h2>BENEFITS OF THE STUDY</h2>
While we do not expect you to personally benefit from participating in this
study, your participation may help us understand how the general public
perceives computer security and privacy in the media, and may inform better
system designs to account for common misconceptions, more effective ways of
encouraging the adoption of good computer security and privacy practices, and
more accurate portrayal of security and privacy in the media.

<h2>SOURCE OF FUNDING</h2>
The study team and/or the University of Washington is receiving financial
support from the National Science Foundation.

<h2>CONFIDENTIALITY OF RESEARCH INFORMATION</h2>
All data collected will be anonymous but tied to a unique ID generated for your
computer. We may offer our data to other research teams.

<h2>USE OF INFORMATION</h2>
<h3>Commercial Use</h3>
The data we collect as part of this research may be used for commercial profit,
such as using this data to improve the quality of movies and TV shows. 
There is no plan to share this profit with you.

<h3>Using Your Data in Future Research</h3>
The information that we obtain from you for this study might be used for
future studies. If we do so, that information may then be used for future
research studies or given to another investigator without getting
additional permission from you.

<h2>OTHER INFORMATION</h2>
You may refuse to participate and you are free to withdraw from this study at
any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise
entitled.
